    <h2>
      Participant of Hit The North
    </h2>
    
<p>
  We're happy to announce we've been selected for the Hit the North talent development program.
</p>

<p>
  Hit the North is a unique collaboration between festivals, media, venues and educative institutions from the north of the Netherlands. Hit the North is established to stimulate professional talent development in Groningen, Friesland and Drenthe. Northern pop culture is unique, but often artists experience many difficulties that hold them back from really breaking through. 
</p>

<p>
  Over a period of one year nine participating acts are offered knowledge, facilities and network. The goal? To enhance their professional music career. Hit the North is focused on practical experience. Participants will participate in several bootcamps and get a chance to play on a stage during Eurosonic Noorderslag in January. The Hit the North-programme is necessary for new and upcoming artists, because the making it in and understanding the music industry has proven to be difficult. Especially, knowledge of the field and the artistic development need extra attention and improvement.
